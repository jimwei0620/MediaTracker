# Media Tracker
## Purpose


**Media Tracker** is an android application for people who likes to keep track of movies, tv series, and content that
they watch. This application use the Jikan API, AniList GraphQL, IMDb API, and hopefully MyDramaList API to perform database searches
and storing information about a specific show. The goal of this project is to create an app so that users are able to
store information about anime, drama, movies and more in one app.

## Update January 2021
I have decided to stop adding features to this project. This is mainly because adding more "functions" or "sources" will simply be repetitive and I
would not be able to gain much from doing so. Initially I had intended to complete the project in some sense, however due to the pandemic and my school/extra curricular activies, I did not have much time to work on this at all. Honestly, looking back at this project, I believe that I have acquired many skills from utilizing REST APIs, external databases, to user authentication. Although this project might be seen as "unfinished", but to me I have accomplished what I originally intended to do and it's time for me to move on.
