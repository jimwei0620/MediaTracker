# Media Tracker
## Purpose


**Media Tracker** is an android application for people who likes to keep track of movies, tv series, and content that
they watch. This application use the Jikan API, AniList GraphQL, IMDb API, and hopefully MyDramaList API to perform database searches
and storing information about a specific show. The goal of this project is to create an app so that users are able to
store information about anime, drama, movies and more in one app.

- Save the data locally on the phone
- Search and sort the lists, items
- Search MAL and ANIList items and save it
- Add and save tags to items
- Add and delete items
- Add Rating, Review, and Status for all items

## Working on
- Implement information syncing
- Improve overall UI for more functionality and to be more visually appealing 
- Finish implementation of Genre, Top, Seasons tabs...
- Refactor code and document/delete garbage code
- Adding more sources
